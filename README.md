## Database Setup

The database schema and initial data are located in `database/employee_db.sql`.

1.  Create a MySQL database named `employee_db`.
2.  Use a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to execute the SQL script in `database/employee_db.sql`.
3.  Update the database connection details in `Conn.java` to match your MySQL server settings.
